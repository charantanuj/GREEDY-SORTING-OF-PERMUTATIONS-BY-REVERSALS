# GREEDY-SORTING-OF-PERMUTATIONS-BY-REVERSALS
Genome rearrangement is a research area capturing wide attention in molecular biology. The reversal distance problem is one of the most widely studied models of genome rearrangements in inferring the evolutionary relationship between two genomes at chromosome level. The problem of estimating reversal distance between two genomes is modeled as sorting by reversals. In our project, the objective is to find the shortest series of reversals that transforms one genome into another genome and we'll optimize the number of reversals. In this, we'll be analyzing the performances of various algorithms such as simple greedy sort by reversals, break-point reversal sort, improved break-point reversal sort for genomic rearrangement.
